Tools for reservoir gods libraries

PUREBOT is a tool for easily compiling code made with godlib.
You can drag and drop PRJ files onto it and it will compile and link them.

Install the PUREBOT application for PRJ file types, then you can double click on a PRJ file to compile and link that project.

You can even create compound PRJ files for PUREBOT that will build multiple projects - the SAMPLES.PRJ is an example of this.
